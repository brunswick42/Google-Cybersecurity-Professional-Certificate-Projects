## Professional Statement

I will spend time refining this as I work through the rest of the courses. Currently it is simply a point form version with some ideas.

Skills: strong written and verbal communication, data analysis, detail oriented
Values: ethical behaviour, adhering to laws and professional codes of conduct, comitted to ensuring equitable access and creating an environment that is welcoming to all.

1. What most interests me about the field of cybersecurity?
I have a strong interest in crime and would like to play a part in preventing it. However, I am also extremely attracted to technical aspects. I like to understand how systems work, to problem solve, and always be looking for new challenges.

2. Who is the audience for my professional statement (e.g., cybersecurity recruiters,
specific organizations, government employers, etc.)?
The audience for my professional statement is cybersecurity recruiters.

3. In what ways can my strengths, values, and interest in cybersecurity support the
security goals of various organizations?
My values and experience show that I am able to work with confidential client information without sharing it with others and ensuring that we maintain appropriate levels of privacy. With my strong communication skills, I am able to interact with clients and other stakeholders, and I also enjoy writing reports to share new knowledge we have gained. This is especially import for research roles where you have to convey new ideas to your audience all of the time.
