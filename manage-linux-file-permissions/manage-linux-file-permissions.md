# File permissions in Linux
## Project description
In this project, I will demonstrate my knowledge of Linux for managing file permissions based on the following fictional scenario:

You are a security professional at a large organization who largely works with the organization's research team. Part of your job is to ensure users are authorized with the appropriate permissions to maintain the security of the system.
You need to examine existing permissions on the file system, and determine if the permissions match the authorization that dhould be given. In cases where the permissions do not match the requirements, they will need to be modified to
authorized the appropriate users and remove and unauthorized access that should not be allowed.
